# "Diagram of all space and time" poster

This repo holds my attempt at producing a poster from Carl Sagan's ["Diagram of all space and time"][loc].

The goal is to take the original drawing and tweak it so that it can be printed and hung on my wall.

Here is what it looks like:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Original</th>
<th>Poster</th>
</tr>
<tr>

<td><a href="./original.tiff"><img src="./original-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Carl Sagan's original diagram"></a></td>
<td><a href="./poster.tiff"><img src="./poster-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Poster version"></a></td>

</tr>
</table>
